## 🐍 LeetCode Journey: Structured Notebooks & Deep Dives

This repository documents my systematic approach to solving LeetCode problems. The solutions are grouped into focused Jupyter Notebooks, with each file containing a set of **10 sequential problems**. Every notebook serves as a dedicated study session, featuring not only the final, optimized code but also detailed explanations, complexity analysis, and solution exploration.

### 📂 Repository Structure

The files are organized sequentially in the root directory, following a clear naming convention:

| File Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `leetcode1to10.ipynb` | Solutions and detailed analysis for LeetCode Problems 1 through 10. |
| `leetcode11to20.ipynb` | Solutions and detailed analysis for LeetCode Problems 11 through 20. |
| `leetcode21to30.ipynb` | Solutions and detailed analysis for LeetCode Problems 21 through 30, and so on. |
| `README.md` | This file. |

### 💡 Notebook Philosophy and Content

Every notebook adheres to a consistent, structured format to maximize learning and review:

1.  **Problem Statement:** A clear, concise restatement of the LeetCode problem.
2.  **Brute-Force (Initial) Approach:** A demonstration and analysis of the simplest, often least efficient, solution.
3.  **Optimal Algorithm:** The final, accepted solution with the best time complexity.
4.  **Complexity Analysis:** Detailed breakdown of the **Time ($O$)** and **Space ($\Omega$)** complexity for both approaches.
5.  **Code Implementation:** The clean, runnable Python code.
6.  **Example Usage:** Inline test cases and execution results to confirm correctness.

### 🛠️ Technology Stack

  * **Primary Language:** Python 3.x
  * **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook (for interactive analysis and documentation)
  * **Libraries:** Primarily standard library tools, emphasizing core data structures and algorithms.

### 🚀 Getting Started

To explore the solutions and explanations interactively, you will need a Python environment with Jupyter Notebook installed.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your Repository URL]
    cd [Your Repository Name]
    ```
2.  **Install Required Dependencies (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    pip install jupyter pandas numpy
    ```
3.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook/Lab:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    # OR
    jupyter lab
    ```
4.  Open any of the `leetcodeXXtoYY.ipynb` files in the launched interface to begin your review.

### ⭐ Key Algorithmic Concepts Covered
