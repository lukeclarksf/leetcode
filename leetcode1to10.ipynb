    "The LeetCode problem **Two Sum** is frequently the very first problem encountered by aspiring programmers on the platform, serving as a foundational test of array manipulation and basic data structure knowledge. The challenge is deceptively simple: given an array of integers, $nums$, and an integer target, return the indices of the two numbers in $nums$ that add up to the target. The problem explicitly states that there will be exactly one valid solution, and you may not use the same element twice. This constraint means we are searching for two distinct positions, $i$ and $j$, such that $nums[i] + nums[j] = target$.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "The most straightforward method to solve this, the **Brute-Force Approach**, is to check every single combination of two numbers in the array. This involves using two nested loops. The outer loop iterates with index $i$ from the beginning of the array up to the second-to-last element. The inner loop, controlled by index $j$, starts from $i + 1$ (to avoid using the same element twice and to prevent checking pairs already evaluated) and goes to the end of the array. Inside the inner loop, a simple conditional check is performed: if $nums[i] + nums[j]$ equals $target$, the indices $i$ and $j$ are returned immediately. This method is easy to understand and implement but is highly inefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "The inefficiency of the brute-force method stems directly from its **time complexity**. If the array contains $N$ elements, the outer loop runs $N-1$ times, and the inner loop runs approximately $N$ times in the worst-case scenario (when the solution is the last pair). This results in a total number of operations proportional to $N^2$. Therefore, the time complexity is $O(N^2)$. For small arrays, this is acceptable, but for large arrays with thousands or tens of thousands of elements, an $O(N^2)$ solution quickly becomes too slow, causing a **Time Limit Exceeded (TLE)** error on the LeetCode judge. A more performant solution is required to satisfy the time constraints of typical programming interviews and competitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "To dramatically improve the performance, we must find a way to avoid the inner loop. The key insight is to realize that for any given number $x$ (which is $nums[i]$), the second number required to hit the target, let's call it the **complement**, must be $target - x$. If we could instantly know whether this complement exists in the remaining part of the array, we could solve the problem in a single pass. This realization naturally leads us to consider using a data structure optimized for fast lookups.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal data structure for solving the Two Sum problem is the **Hash Map**, also known as a dictionary or hash table. Hash maps are designed to provide near-instantaneous average time complexity for both insertion and retrieval operations, specifically $O(1)$. By using a hash map, we can effectively trade some space complexity for a massive gain in time complexity, a common and valuable technique in algorithm design.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "The **One-Pass Hash Map Approach** works by iterating through the array only once. As we process each number $nums[i]$ at index $i$, we first calculate its required complement: $complement = target - nums[i]$. Instead of looking forward in the rest of the array, we check our hash map to see if we have **already processed** this complement in a previous iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "If the calculated complement is found as a key in the hash map, it means we have previously encountered the first number of our pair. Since the hash map stores the index of that previous number as its value, we can immediately return the index stored in the map for the complement and the current index $i$. This is the moment the solution is found, and the function terminates.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "If the complement is **not** found in the hash map, it means the current number, $nums[i]$, is not the second number of any pair we have previously started forming. In this case, the current number itself might be the first number of a future pair. We therefore add $nums[i]$ as a key to the hash map, setting its value to its current index $i$, and then proceed to the next element in the array. This ensures that any subsequent elements can instantly check against the number we just processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "The major advantage of the hash map approach is its **linear time complexity**, $O(N)$. Because the entire list is traversed only once, and each lookup or insertion operation takes an average of $O(1)$ time, the total execution time scales linearly with the size of the input array. This $O(N)$ solution is highly efficient and is the intended, accepted solution for this problem, comfortably passing the time limit constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the transition from the $O(N^2)$ brute-force solution to the $O(N)$ hash map solution illustrates a fundamental principle in algorithm optimization: leveraging an appropriate data structure (the hash map, in this case) to convert a slow search operation within a loop into a fast, constant-time lookup operation.  This simple, yet powerful, technique is essential for solving many other related algorithmic problems."
