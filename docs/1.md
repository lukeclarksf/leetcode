# 🧩 1. Two Sum (Easy)

**[Problem Link (External)]**: [LeetCode - Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

## 📝 Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

## 🧠 Approach: Hash Map (One-Pass)

The most efficient solution avoids the $O(n^2)$ brute force method by leveraging a **Hash Map** (Python `dict`) for $O(1)$ lookups.

### The Core Idea: Searching for the Complement

Instead of searching the rest of the array for the second number, we determine the **complement** required for the current number to hit the target.

1.  We iterate through the array once.
2.  At each element `num`, we calculate: `complement = target - num`.
3.  We check if this `complement` already exists in our `num_map` (our dictionary).
    * **If found:** We have our two numbers! We return the stored index of the complement and the current index.
    * **If not found:** We store the current number and its index in the map for future lookups.
