## ❓ Problem Description

You are given two **non-empty linked lists** representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in **reverse order**, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list (also in reverse order).

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

### Example

**Input:** `l1 = [2,4,3]`, `l2 = [5,6,4]`
**Output:** `[7,0,8]`
**Explanation:** $342 + 465 = 807$. The output list represents $807$ in reverse.

## 💡 Solution Approach: Simulation of Grade-School Addition

The structure of the input—digits in **reverse order**—is key. It means the head of the list corresponds to the ones place, allowing us to perform long addition by traversing the lists simultaneously from head to tail.

### The Iterative Process

We use an iterative approach, maintaining a **`carry`** variable to handle overflow whenever the sum of the digits exceeds $9$.

1.  **Initialize:** A `dummy` node is created to anchor the result list, and a `current` pointer tracks the tail of the sum list. `carry` is set to $0$.
2.  **Iterate:** We loop until **both** lists are exhausted **AND** the `carry` is $0$.
3.  **Summation:** In each step, we calculate the sum of the current digits from $l1$ and $l2$ (using $0$ if a list is exhausted) plus the incoming `carry`.
4.  **Result & Carry Update:**
    * The digit for the new node is $sum \pmod{10}$.
    * The new `carry` is $sum // 10$.
5.  **List Building:** A new node is created with the result digit and appended to the result list via the `current` pointer.
